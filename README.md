A Python-based AI for playing Minesweeper, developed for CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. The project features minesweeper.py, implementing game logic and a knowledge-based AI using propositional logic to infer safe cells and mines, and runner.py, which provides a graphical interface via Pygame. The AI tracks cells as tuples (i, j) and uses a Sentence class to represent logical constraints, ensuring precise mine detection. Run python runner.py to see the AI tackle the classic puzzle game!
